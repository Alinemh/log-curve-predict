TOPIC: Predicting missing log data

WORFLOW
1- EXTRACTING (RHOB,DTCO,DTSM) SYNTHETIC DATA
2- DATA FORMATING 
3- (80% DATA - TRAINING) BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
4- (20% DATA - TESTING) ACCURACY MEASUREMENT
  
  
Conclusion:


Wayforward:
1) Real industry data training required
1.1) Crosscheck rock phyiscs against ML
1.2) Depth trend analysis
2) Application of petrophysics, rock physics and geomechaincs prediction and model building
3) Well log data quick look and analysis
4) Improvement with the application of DL
