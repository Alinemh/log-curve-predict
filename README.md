TOPIC: Predicting missing log data

WORFLOW
1- EXTRACTING (RHOB,DTCO,DTSM) SYNTHETIC DATA
2- DATA FORMATING 
3- (80% DATA - TRAINING) BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
4- (20% DATA - TESTING) ACCURACY MEASUREMENT
  
  
Conclusion:
Our model produces comparable predictions with rock physics based estimations (Marmousi2 Model, 2004). Our focus on estimating missing Vs logs; however, this approach can be extended to estimating any other kinds of missing logs using different input log types.

Wayforward:
1) Real industry data training required
1.1) Crosscheck rock phyiscs against ML
1.2) Depth trend analysis
2) Application of petrophysics, rock physics and geomechaincs prediction and model building
3) Well log data quick look and analysis
4) Improvement with the application of DL
